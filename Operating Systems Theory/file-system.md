In a classic Hard Drive, there is multiple arms writing on the disks, the arm stays fixed and turn the disk to select the space it will read.

A disk do 200 rounds per seconds, 7400 rounds per minutes for the fastest.
There are anti-choc mecanisum to prevent the friction and inertia generated by those rounds.

Each disk is dispatched in multiple sectors (3).

A HDD contains:
- a bisurface plate
- 1 read head per surface
- sectors (512o / 4094o)
- a cylinder (which align the heads)

Each disk is put on the track it need to read. This movement is between 10ms and 50ms, which refer to an eternity for the processor.

The second time is linked to the latency: it need to the arm finish the required read sector. It's latency (between 60 rps and 200 rps).

There is multiple storage types:
Constant Linear Velocity (which is not adapted to hard drives but only for CD, DVD and Bluray because it increase the "seek time"): the density on the disk is the same everywhere but not the speed.

For the HDD, the used technology is the "Constant Angular Velocity": The speed is constant, the density variate (more dense at the center than the exterior). With this density variation, the data stream is more constant.
